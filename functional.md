# Bunny Run Game



## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* In this game, you play as one of the knights of Camelot, and you must escape the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog. This is loosely based off of the scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
* This game was programmed with https://runpython.org.
* The game directly starts, and there is no enter game screen. You must move your character to try to escape the rabbit. The rabbit will follow, and try to catch up to the player. The goal of the game is to esacpe the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog for as long as possible.
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
     *The knight of Camelot will respond to key input (w,a,s,d) to move up, down, left, or right.*
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
     *This program does not respond to mouse input.*
* The knight of Camelot will respond to key input (w,a,s,d) to move up, down, left, or right through the sprites.
* There will be at least one set of image sprites for the knight of Camelot, there will be background sprites, and there will be a set of sprites for the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog. These can be found under the images folder in this program.
* The user doesn't have to do anything to install the program, because it is run off of https://runpython.org.

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.
